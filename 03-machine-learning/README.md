## 👪 Customer Segmentation

<br>

- **Goal:** I separate the customer 4 groups (1. New Customer 2. Core Loyalists (loyal customer) 3. At-Risk Loyalists (customers at lisk discontinuing service) and 4. Lost Customers) base on their shopping behavior.
- **Tool:** K-means in R
- **Impact:** Customer segmentation helps me identify customer group at high risk of discontinuing service, which is important for differential marketing strategies for each customer group.
