# 📢 Business Insight
I analyzed the data to find answers to three points:
1. **Golden Hour**: To find the best time to arrange staff for packing and delivery.
2. **Golden Day**: To find the peak days of each week to ensure we have enough stock for customers.
3. **Maximum Reorder**: To find out what products customers "Reorder Frequency & Cycle", in order to prepare the inventory management.
4. **Off-Peak Strategy:** To find the days and times with the fewest customer orders, in order to plan special discount such as "Flash Sale" promotion.
